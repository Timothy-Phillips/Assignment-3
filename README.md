# Assignment-3

I was unable to complete the programming assignment, I really struggled with the Java required to implement LockFreeLists. I am submitting this so I can get at least the 20% for documentation.

Also, the reason why in problem 1 there are more presents than notes is because when the servants meet the end condition that adds the last few gifts to the pile, they have not yet added notes to the last gifts they pulled out from the bag.

The code (that doesnt work) is ran with the following command:

javac *.java && java Temperature_Readings
